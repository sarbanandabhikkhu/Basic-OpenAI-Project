# Basic OpenAI Project

> Basic Text and Image Generating App with OpenAI (ChatGPT), Next.js and React.js

This is a basic example of how to have a serverless publicly available website that does **not** leak your OpenAI API key to the public.

Just create a new `.env` file and simply add your OpenAI API key with the variable and you're ready to go.

Use `npm run dev` to host locally @ `localhost:3000`. Or use `npm run build` and then `npm run start` to preview the public build. Push up to a free Vercel account to host it and share it with the world.
